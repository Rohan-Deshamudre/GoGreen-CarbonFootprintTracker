Meeting 1: 14-feb (happy valentines day!)

## Maven vs gradle:
- Maven uses xml
- Gradle uses groovy/kotlin (way more readable)
- Future cse projects require maven, but we are allowed to use gradle now if we want to.

## Group contract
- Absence:
    - Be clear about when you can/can’t come
    - Let know at least 24 hours in advance
- Coming late:
    - Cake rule: bring cake next meeting
- Missed deadlines:
    - Better communication: ask for help
    - Depends on priority on the issue
    - Avoid creating tasks that depend on other people

## Next meeting (monday 18):
- Don’t touch code yet
- Sophie will be responsible for dividing the tasks
- Get to know the tools (git, IDE, maven/gradle ...)
- Take a look at the rubric (on brightspace)
