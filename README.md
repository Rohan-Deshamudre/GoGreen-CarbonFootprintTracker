Part 1: Strengths / Weaknesses
	Strengths
		I don’t give up easily.
			Making sure that I finish my work, no matter how difficult / frustrating the work might be - using all resources I have at my disposal: team members, docs, any online resources

		I care about other people
			Checking to make sure that team members are coping with the workload - if they need help with anything making sure that everyone is able to hit deadlines, and making sure that the workload is balanced so as not to cause friction between team members.

	Weaknesses
		Personal expectations are too high / not able to recognise personal strengths
			Can spend a lot of time being self-critical of personal work even though it’s at the same level of other team members - wasting time / energy on things that are less pressing, focusing on the minutia rather than the big picture

		Overly Negative
			Tendency to focus on the negative rather than the positive of a situation / outcome even if the positives vastly outweigh the negatives. This can cause personal stress and put a strain on group dynamics / communication


Part 2: How I plan to GROW
	Learning Goal(s)
	Working on group communication so as to avoid causing conflict within the team due to previously mentioned 	weakness. Progression can be marked through the peer review process that will be used throughout the project - 	deadline of learning goal will be the end of the project.

	Reality
		It has been a long-standing goal of mine due to needing to be able to function in different environments with people from different backgrounds. This will be my first time working in such a large group - all my previous experience has been in much smaller groups / solo. So far I have worked in groups where I have either known one person within the group or everyone, being thrown into a completely new environment with completely new people has been difficult but given time to adjust it should work out well.

	Options
		The most important thing to do is to ask for feedback from other members within the group. The peer-review	system, while helpful and definitely provides some marker of progress, is only done once in a while. Personally asking other members of the team will provide a secondary opportunity for feedback but I think the set peer-review system will be most important. I personally struggle to ask questions and look for feedback when it comes to personal development of social skills as opposed to technical skills

	Will
		I’ll continue to communicate and make an effort to ask for feedback. This will be over the course of the project, so it might be a good idea to set points over the project to dedicate to helping the group with soft skills - communication in my case.
