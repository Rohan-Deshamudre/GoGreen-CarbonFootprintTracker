Part 1: Strengths / Weaknesses
	Strengths
		I don’t give up easily.
			Making sure that I finish my work, no matter how difficult / frustrating the work might be - using all resources I have at my disposal: team members, docs, any online resources

		I care about other people
			Checking to make sure that team members are coping with the workload - if they need help with anything making sure that everyone is able to hit deadlines, and making sure that the workload is balanced so as not to cause friction between team members.

	Weaknesses
		Personal expectations are too high / not able to recognise personal strengths
			Can spend a lot of time being self-critical of personal work even though it’s at the same level of other team members - wasting time / energy on things that are less pressing, focusing on the minutia rather than the big picture

		Overly Negative
			Tendency to focus on the negative rather than the positive of a situation / outcome even if the positives vastly outweigh the negatives. This can cause personal stress and put a strain on group dynamics / communication


Part 2: How I plan to GROW
	Learning Goal(s)
	Working on group communication so as to avoid causing conflict within the team due to previously mentioned 	weakness. Progression can be marked through the peer review process that will be used throughout the project - 	deadline of learning goal will be the end of the project.

	Reality
		It has been a long-standing goal of mine due to needing to be able to function in different environments with people from different backgrounds. This will be my first time working in such a large group - all my previous experience has been in much smaller groups / solo. So far I have worked in groups where I have either known one person within the group or everyone, being thrown into a completely new environment with completely new people has been difficult but given time to adjust it should work out well.

	Options
		The most important thing to do is to ask for feedback from other members within the group. The peer-review	system, while helpful and definitely provides some marker of progress, is only done once in a while. Personally asking other members of the team will provide a secondary opportunity for feedback but I think the set peer-review system will be most important. I personally struggle to ask questions and look for feedback when it comes to personal development of social skills as opposed to technical skills

	Will
		I’ll continue to communicate and make an effort to ask for feedback. This will be over the course of the project, so it might be a good idea to set points over the project to dedicate to helping the group with soft skills - communication in my case.

Part 1: Strengths / Weaknesses
    Strong Points
        I am committed and hardworking
            Example: Once I start something I cannot leave it unfinished. I will spend how much ever time is required to finish the task that I am working on
            In a team: It is important to finish what you are responsible for as otherwise it affects the whole team. 

        I can work well with a team
            Example: I play Cricket which is a team sport and requires coordination with other team members. 
            In a team: Teamwork is important in a big project as the tasks can be split well which increases efficiency and also have support from other members for areas where we may be struggling. 

    Weak Points
        I don’t like to ask others for help even if I may be struggling
            Example: If I am having an issue with something, I spend too much time on my own trying to figure out the solution for it rather than asking someone for help which can solve my problem much quicker.
            In a team: It is important to be time efficient and also make use of the knowledge of your other team members to get to a solution rather than struggling for a long time.

        I tend to procrastinate while I am working on something that I am not good at/ dislike
            Example: I was not really a fan of the CO course in Q1 and got distracted every 10-15 minutes while trying to study for it. I kept switching to youtube/games which meant I wasted time and kept procrastinating.
            In a team: If there is something I don’t like to do, maybe there is someone else who is better than me or likes doing it so the tasks can be assigned according to what we are good at and like to do.

Part 2: Goals
    Learning Goal:
        Get better at Java and coding in general
            Important: I am studying CS so it’s quite important that I get good at coding. 
            Success: I need to spend a lot of time practicing and creating some smaller projects of my own trying things out.

        Stay organized and plan well
            Important: It is important to stay organized as otherwise I may end up cramming everything last minute which will reduce the quality of what I am doing plus I may encounter some issues that require time to solve.
            Success: Make a plan and timetable and stick to it as much as possible. Make sure to keep it realistic and spread out the work over time.

        Communicate well with team mates
            Important: If two people are working on the same thing, it is a waste of time as that time could be used for something different.
            Success: Inform group about what I have worked on and what I am going to do next and make sure I know what they are working on

        Stick to a good sleep schedule
            Important: I won’t get tired during the day due to lack of sleep and will have more time and energy to work
            Success: Stop taking mid day naps and go to bed early and wake up early.

    Reality
        I am making sure I am prepared for group meetings and know what needs to be done next. 
        I need to spend more time working on my java coding skills 
        I tend to go to bed quite late which makes waking up early hard and makes me want to take naps during the day. I need to stick to a good sleep schedule so that I get good amount of time during the day to work.

    Options
        Options: go to bed on time, spend time working on Java, stick to planned timetable
        Use most: spend more time on coding Java, stick to schedule
        Stopping: don’t like java so I get distracted, lots of other things to do(study for Algo resits), partying with friends, playing games

    Will 
        To do: Find interesting projects to work on for Java, stick to timetable, stop procrastinating and stay focused, ask for help when needed
        First step: start doing work well in advance so I don’t cram it all in the last minute
        Teammates help: stay motivated, do their work on time, help each other when needed.
