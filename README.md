Personal Plan - Rohan Deshamudre

PART 1 - STRENGTHS/WEAKNESSES

STRONG POINTS
I am committed and hardworking
Example: Once I start something I cannot leave it unfinished. I will spend how much ever time is required to finish the task that I am working on
In a team: It is important to finish what you are responsible for as otherwise it affects the whole team. 
I can work well with a team
Example: I play Cricket which is a team sport and requires coordination with other team members. 
In a team: Teamwork is important in a big project as the tasks can be split well which increases efficiency and also have support from other members for areas where we may be struggling. 

WEAK POINTS
I don’t like to ask others for help even if I may be struggling
Example: If I am having an issue with something, I spend too much time on my own trying to figure out the solution for it rather than asking someone for help which can solve my problem much quicker.
In a team: It is important to be time efficient and also make use of the knowledge of your other team members to get to a solution rather than struggling for a long time.
I tend to procrastinate while I am working on something that I am not good at/ dislike
Example: I was not really a fan of the CO course in Q1 and got distracted every 10-15 minutes while trying to study for it. I kept switching to youtube/games which meant I wasted time and kept procrastinating
In a team: If there is something I don’t like to do, maybe there is someone else who is better than me or likes doing it so the tasks can be assigned according to what we are good at and like to do.

PART 2 - GOALS

LEARNING GOAL:
Get better at Java and coding in general
Important: I am studying CS so it’s quite important that I get good at coding. 
Success: I need to spend a lot of time practicing and creating some smaller projects of my own trying things out.
Stay organized and plan well
Important: It is important to stay organized as otherwise I may end up cramming everything last minute which will reduce the quality of what I am doing plus I may encounter some issues that require time to solve.
Success: Make a plan and timetable and stick to it as much as possible. Make sure to keep it realistic and spread out the work over time.
Communicate well with team mates
Important: If two people are working on the same thing, it is a waste of time as that time could be used for something different.
Success: Inform group about what I have worked on and what I am going to do next and make sure I know what they are working on
Stick to a good sleep schedule
Important: I won’t get tired during the day due to lack of sleep and will have more time and energy to work
Success: Stop taking mid day naps and go to bed early and wake up early.

REALITY
I am making sure I am prepared for group meetings and know what needs to be done next. 
I need to spend more time working on my java coding skills 
I tend to go to bed quite late which makes waking up early hard and makes me want to take naps during the day. I need to stick to a good sleep schedule so that I get good amount of time during the day to work.
Options
Options: go to bed on time, spend time working on Java, stick to planned timetable
Use most: spend more time on coding Java, stick to schedule
Stopping: don’t like java so I get distracted, lots of other things to do(study for Algo resits), partying with friends, playing games

WILL 
To do: Find interesting projects to work on for Java, stick to timetable, stop procrastinating and stay focused, ask for help when needed
First step: start doing work well in advance so I don’t cram it all in the last minute
Teammates help: stay motivated, do their work on time, help each other when needed.
